# Mentat Template JS

A full-stack JavaScript template project with React frontend and Express backend, both using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository using this template. On the [repository page](https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat-template-js), click "Use this template" on the top right, then select 'Create a new repository'.

2. On the next screen, choose a name for your project, then click 'Create repository'.

3. Install Mentat on your GitHub account, if you haven't already. See instructions [here](https://mentat.ai/docs).

4. Add the new repository to your Mentat Installation.

a. If you're installing Mentat for the first time, select your new repository on the 'Setup Installation' page.
b. If you've already installed Mentat, go to the [settings page](https://mentat.ai/settings) and click 'Manage Repositories', and select your new repository from the drop-down menu to add it to your installation.

5. If Mentat was installed properly, you should see an open GitHub issue in your new repository called 'MentatBot Setup'. This issue will guide you through advanced configuration.

You're all set! You can begin using Mentat by
